This repository is a curated collection of coding challenges Iâ€™ve followed along with, inspired by Daniel Shiffman from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain).<br>
It features programs that visualize mathematical concepts through a blend of code and art, primarily using Processing and p5.js
### Setup
For the Processing projects you just need to download the Processing IDE [here](https://processing.org/). Any library needed can be downloaded from the IDE by going in the tab Sketch > Import Library > Manage Libraries and then searching the library name.

For the p5 projects I use vscode and the extension p5.vscode. To find out more info and set it up yourself read the [official guide](https://p5js.org/tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/#vscode)
