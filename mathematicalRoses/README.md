A rose curve is a type of mathematical curve that resembles the shape of a flower with petals. It's defined using polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) by an equation of the form:

$$
r(\theta) = a \cdot \cos(k\theta) \quad \text{or} \quad r(\theta) = a \cdot \sin(k\theta)
$$

Where:
- r is the radius (distance from the origin),
- $\theta$ is the angle (in radians),
- a is a constant that affects the size of the petals,
- k is a constant that determines the number of petals.
