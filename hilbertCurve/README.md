  The Hilbert curve is a space filling fractal, meaning it's a continuous line that twists and turns in such a way that it passes through every point in a square area. The more mathematically accurate definition of the Hilbert curve requires an infinite number of iterations so this implementation is more accurately called a pseudo Hilbert curve, which approximates the true curve at a finite level of detail.
